# LD40
My submission for Ludum Dare 40. Theme: The more you have, the worse it is.


<b>Description:</b>

Ethereal is a game where the more light there is, the worse it gets. You play as a poor soul lost in a dark maze, trying to find his way out whilst avoiding ghouls.

Navigate by increasing the intensity of your light, but beware of light-sensitive enemies. If you retract fast enough, you might just get away.

<b>Controls:</b>

Move with WASD
Increase/Decrease Light Intensity with Mouse Scroll Wheel (or M and N respectively on a laptop)

<b>Note:</b>

Music is off by default, as I felt it made the atmosphere more tense, but there is an option to turn it on.

If you're stuck on a particularly hard level, press P to skip it.

Have fun!
